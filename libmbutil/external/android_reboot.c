 * that have a block device (i.e. not tmpfs filesystems) by calling
 * emergency_remount(), which knows how to force the remount to read-only.
 * Unfortunately, that is asynchronous, and just schedules the work and
 * returns.  The best way to determine if it is done is to read /proc/mounts
 * repeatedly until there are no more writable filesystems mounted on
