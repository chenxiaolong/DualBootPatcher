# Building the Patcher for Windows (with MSVC)

Building DualBootPatcher for Windows using MSVC is currently unsupported. It is very likely that the compilation will fail. If possible, build with mingw-w64 instead.

I will not actively work on MSVC support, but I will not reject pull requests for it either.
