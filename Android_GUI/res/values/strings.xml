        to take effect.\n\nTo use individual app sharing, the APK/data sharing has to be enabled in
        each ROM. For example: From the primary ROM, enable data sharing for Chrome. Chrome will
        start using the shared data directory. Then boot into another ROM and also enable data
        sharing for Chrome. It will now use the same shared directory. The same applies for
